        <p>
            In my time as a Boy Scout, I did a lot, like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Held the position of Senior Patrol Leader, head of the troop, and numerous other leadership positions like Patrol Leader, Quartermaster, and Assistant Senior Patrol Leader.
                My troop were strong believers in the troop being "boy-led", meaning that the scouts were in charge of the troop and the leaders were there to help and guide us.
            </li>
            <li>Logged hundreds of service hours with various things like trash pickup, maintaining campgrounds, serving local food banks and running food drives, and many more.</li>
            <li>Traveled to places like Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Iowa, South Dakota, Wisconsin, West Virginia. I went on various high adventures at some of these places.
                <ul>
                    <li>My first high adventure was traveling to South Dakota and spending a week hiking and camping in the Black Hills. From filtering and purifying stream water to drink, to scrambling and climbing
                        rocks, and exploring the caves, this was a great experience. We also went on a hike to the top of Harney Peak, the highest point in the Black Hills. This was a great experience, as we got to see 
                        the entire Black Hills from the top. We took a trip to Wind Cave National Park, where we took a candlelit tour through the cave. We traveled deep into the cave, saw famous formations in the cave 
                        that showed some of the history, like previous explorers who got lost in the cave. During the candlelit tour, we extinguished our flames and experienced total darkness, which was a wild experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another high adventure I did was horseback camping in Colorado. The troop learned how to care for, saddle, and ride horses. We rode horses for 3 days and camped in the mountains.
                        We ate cowboy dinners and cooked them over the fire. Traversing the mountains on a horse was a great and challenging experience, especially if the horses weren't in the mood to cooperate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My favorite high adventure was in Michigan/Wisconsin, when my troop spent a week on a tall ship manning it and traveling to various Apostle Islands in Lake Superior.
                        This was only half of the trip, the other half being white water rafting in Michigan, scuba diving a ship wreck in lake Superior, and sea kayaking to some underwater caves.

            </li>
