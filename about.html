            Hello There!<br>
            My name is Steve Dormady and I am currently a student at James Madison University studying Computer Science!
            In my time as a CS student, I have learned a lot about various programming languages and have become very familiar with windows (former MAC user)!

            I have gone on mission trips with my church every summer since 2017. On these trips, we travel around the country to an area in need.
            We make a crew with other adults and youth attending the work camp and complete repairs on a house
